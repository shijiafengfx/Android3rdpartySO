 ---------------

Useful stuff that doesn't belong anywhere else goes in this directory:

ideas.txt - The Mathomatic todo and idea list.

known_bugs.txt - Current list of known Mathomatic bugs.
                 Normally bugs are fixed immediately if they can be.

*.in - Some Mathomatic input files that Mathomatic has trouble with.
